-  Clear editor with confirmation
-  Responsive and colorful toolbar layout

## Methodology 
This project uses Tkinter, Python‚Äôs standard GUI library, to build a simple yet functional text editor. Tkinter provides built-in widgets like buttons, text boxes, and dialogs ‚Äî making it ideal for desktop app development without needing third-party dependencies.

- A toolbar built using tk.Frame that holds all command buttons.
- A text area (tk.Text) where users can write, edit, and view content.
- Functional buttons like New, Open, Save, Undo, Redo, and Clear, each tied to individual functions for clarity and separation of concerns.
- File dialogs and message boxes handled via filedialog and messagebox for a smooth user experience
